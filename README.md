# Code Retreat 2023

CodeRetreat is a coding practice event where developers of all experience levels meet and hone their craft by repeatedly implementing the same small coding exercise via test-driven design and pair or ensemble programming. It can be used any programming language.
What are the learning goals of CodeRetreat?
- Use deliberate practice to explore new techniques
- Learn from other software developers by writing readable and well-designed code together
- Take risks and experiment
- Have fun!
  
# Agenda

- 17:00 - 17:30 Welcome
- 17:30 - 18:15 First rounds of coding, sessions of 45 min pair programming
- 18:15 - 18:30 Retrospective
- 18:30 - 19:15 Further coding. Session of 45 min
- 19:15 - 20:00 Retrospective, networking, closing

# Prereq
- Setup IDE
- Clone repo https://github.com/softwarecraftersdev/kata-bootstraps
- Use unit tests to validate the problem

# Coding Challenge
The objective is to develop a simple application to implement the logic for Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
